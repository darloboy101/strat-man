## Lesson overview

**This lesson provides a brief outline of strategic analysis and describes the difference between an organisation’s external and internal environments.**

As seen previously, the analysis of both environments is necessary in order for organisations to ascertain how they can acquire a sustainable competitive advantage in the market(s) they have chosen to compete in. The main focus here will be on the analysis of the external environment.

You will explore:

 - what strategic analysis means
 - the external environment and the nature of an organisation’s macro-environment
 - the macro-environment’s relationship to strategic decision-making
 - the specific tools used for analysing the macro environment, such as PEST(LE).

##  Strategic analysis and an organisation’s external environment

**The strategic management process allows organisations to make and implement strategic decisions.**

It involves a number of steps concerned with:

-   strategic analysis
-   identification of strategic choices
-   strategy formulation
-   strategy implementation
-   subsequent review of the strategy.

The first step in the process, strategic analysis, enables organisations to analyse their external and internal environments to help executives to determine the most appropriate strategy to follow.

## So, what is strategic analysis?

**In this lecture, Joanna Townend, Senior Teaching Fellow of the Leeds University Business School, outlines what is meant by strategic analysis.**

Joanna provides some basic definitions and illustrates what is involved in strategic analysis, including the analysis of the general and competitive environments.

Within the lecture Joanna mentions some concepts that we are yet to explore, such as SWOT analysis. This is something we will look at later on, so don’t worry if you are currently unfamiliar with this framework.

## The external environment

**The previous lecture provides a simplified description of strategic analysis. In reality, the process is likely to be substantially more complex.**

The complexity that organisations face when they come to analyse their external and internal environments is stressed by Les Worrall:

> [Strategic analysis is] a theoretically informed understanding of the environment in which an organisation is operating, together with an understanding of the organisation’s interaction with its environment in order to improve organisational efficiency and effectiveness by increasing the organisation’s capacity to deploy and redeploy its resources intelligently.
> 
> Worrall (1998, p.3).

As Worrall explains, the complex process of strategic analysis clearly rests on gaining a deep understanding of both the external and internal environments. The focus of this unit however, is on the external environment, the ways it is carved up and defined, and the tools used to analyse it.

### What is the external environment?

**The external environment consists of the factors outside of the organisation that affect how it operates.**

The majority of engineering organisations today face an external environment that is increasingly complex, dynamic and subject to the pressures of international competition and the effects of globalisation.

Consider for example how new business models such as low-cost airlines and, more recently, mobility on demand services such as Uber have affected the rules of competition in the travel and urban mobility industry. Think also about the way in which the global sourcing of product components or ingredients can affect the management of the supply chain and strategic risk, and the profound impact this trend can have when combined with political events such as Brexit.

For many years, the external environment was seen as the main influence on an organisation’s strategic choices (a key proponent of this view is Michael Porter).

Identifying opportunities and threats is indeed a key objective of an environmental analysis. Another key objective is the identification of an attractive industry at sector levels whose structural characteristics are likely to allow organisations to gain above average returns.

### Levels of analysis

**The external environment is normally analysed at different levels using distinct tools and concepts:**

-   The macro-environment
-   The industry or sector
-   The competitive environment

The diagram below illustrates the different layers of the external environment in relation to the organisation. The rest of this lesson will focus on how to describe and analyse the broad macro-environment in which organisations operate.

**The macro-environment**

An analysis of the macro-environment focusses on environmental factors and trends, and their implications for organisations, industries and sectors.

When analysing the macro environment, an engineering firm might focus on economic growth rates, climate change, ageing population etc.

**The industry (or sector)**

An analysis of the industry environment focusses on factors that can have an effect on a particular industry’s potential for profitability.

Examples of specific engineering industries could be the automobile industry, the construction industry or the petroleum industry.

**The competitors and markets**

An analysis of competitors focusses on trying to predict competitors’ strategic moves.

For a company such as Nissan for example, in the US market the major competitors could be Volkswagen, Ford and Tesla.

**The organisation**

At the heart is the organisation itself.

## The macro-environment

**The general or macro-environment is composed of dimensions or factors that exert a broad influence on sectors, industries and firms.**

General environment changes can often seem too big and complex to be predicted and grasped by managers until it is too late to react. That is why analytical tools can help with establishing and preserving organisational awareness of the macro-environment.

The dimensions to take into account in the analysis of a firm’s macro-environment are generally referred to by an acronym, PESTLE, which stands for political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental/ecological. PESTLE constitutes a key tool that helps organisations to understand and analyse their macro-environment. The PESTLE analysis takes into account the different dimensions of the macro-environment that might affect an organisation or industry. There are variations of this tool which add or omit various elements, such as PEST or STEEPLE etc, however here we will focus on PESTLE.

The PESTLE framework categorises the different factors that exist within the macro-environment into six key types, as defined below.

(2017, pp.33-40, 43-46)](https://leeds.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42LgTQStzc4rAe_hSmFm4AJWKaDzsIGIk0EIvrRMoRhy_CqwOciSB-xucTPIubmGOHvo5gCL7eJ46OhFfBJo5yjoTlwjggoAngokCw) for a detailed analysis of these macro-environment factors.

**Political**

The role of the state and other political entities or factors. For example, the stability of governmental institutions, economic and trade policy, fiscal policy, government regulation.

Political factors can affect business activity, for example by creating a lot of uncertainty before major elections that will affect the willingness of companies to take risks. Even when they are known, electoral decisions can create long-term uncertainty and upheaval for organisations, the UK’s decision to leave the EU (Brexit) being a case in point.

**Economic**

The role of individual economic indicators (such as interest rates, unemployment rates, economic growth), the impact of economic cycles and macro-economic trends on sectors and organisations.

For example, changes in income distribution can significantly affect consumption volumes and patterns. Similarly, the USA recently raised import tariffs on steel products considerably; this is likely to have a sudden and substantial impact on companies trading these sorts of goods with the USA.

**Social**

Demographics, income and wealth distribution, geography, and cultural and social trends such as the shared beliefs and attitudes of the population.

Changing demographics have an impact on companies’ market appeal. For example, the furniture production company Ikea always tries to adapt their offer with products that appeal to younger customers, who want design and a certain degree of quality along with low price.

Social norms and cultural values differ widely, both in time and between geographical areas. Even a global brand such as Coca-Cola had to slightly adapt its famous and seemingly universal recipe to cater for local tastes.

**Technological**

The rate of technological change and obsolescence, and new and disruptive technological innovations (for example, new ways of producing or distributing goods or services, or communicating with customers).

Technological innovation can affect or even transform both the life style and buying patterns of customers. The advent of the internet and internet shopping constitutes a clear example which had a major impact on retail organisations in many different sectors.

**Legal**

The legal factors which can affect a wide range of areas such as health and safety, environmental aspects, consumer rights, etc. Formal and informal rules are part of the institutional environment in which organisations compete and can vary significantly between countries.

Legal regulation can affect businesses in many different ways, ranging from a requirement to offer the product for sale in a particular manner (for example with full information about the contents and with proper safety instructions), to banning the use of some substances in a specific market.

**Environmental**

Factors that are concerned with ecologically and ethically responsible ways of conducting business. They stem from increased environmental regulation and increased social awareness of the need for environmentally friendly and sustainable policies and practices.

Increased awareness of socially damaging food over-consumption (ie the obesity crisis) has prompted individual countries to take a variety of measures, including legal measures, to counteract a societal problem that is quickly increasing in most developed countries.

In the UK, the so-called sugar tax has generated different responses from drink manufacturers in order to recoup the cost of this tax. Coca-Cola has decided to keep its original recipe, shrinking the size of the bottle and increasing its price in the process. The manufacturer of a famous Scottish soft-drink, Irn-Bru, has decided instead to halve the drink’s sugar content, creating a significant backlash amongst its loyal customer base.

## Scanning the macro-environment
**Organisations must scan the macro-environment in order to detect signals of fundamental changes in one or more of the PESTLE dimensions. Such signals may initially be very weak.**

**Weak signals** are early signs of future trends or changes that could fundamentally disrupt an organisation’s competitive environment and impact on how it operates.

Think of how the internet and mobile telephony have fundamentally transformed and redefined the ways we conduct business. The impact of this technological change affected a variety of sectors in ways that were probably difficult to envisage when the original brick-sized mobile phones were first commercialised.

According to Fahey and Narayanan (1986), the analysis of the macro-environment can be seen as having three separate aims:

1.  it provides an understanding of current and potential changes taking place in the environment
2.  it provides intelligence for strategic decision-makers
3.  it fosters and supports strategic thinking in organisations.

Read [Schoemaker, P.J.H., and Day, G.S. 2009. How to make sense of weak signals. _MIT Sloan Management Review._ **50**(3), pp.81-89](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2533123~S5).

This article offers an interesting illustration and discussion of the difficulties associated with making sense of weak signals and their consequences.

### Limitations of PESTLE analysis 

**There are limitations inherent to the use of the PESTLE tool:**

First, a PESTLE analysis is not simply a list of disparate and unrelated bullet points. Consideration should be given to the ways in which the dimensions relate to one another, and to their wider ramifications, making the mapping of the macro-context complex and extrapolating into the future particularly difficult. An organisation must try to identify the implications of each factor in its environment.

Second, the rate of change of PESTLE factors in the macro-environment, and their increasing unpredictability, can act to limit the effectiveness of a PESTLE analysis.

Finally, organisations do not normally have much influence on macro-environment factors, although there are exceptions to this – for example when organisations introduce a revolutionary technology that redefines the macro-landscape (eg Apple and touch screen phones). This leads some to argue that we should instead concentrate on the more immediate competitive environment, as this has the greatest impact on an organisation’s markets, products or services.

## Check your understanding

**Now that you have learned about how organisations can use PESTLE analyses to understand their macro-environments, read the illustrative case of BP’s PESTLE analysis in [Chapter 2: Macro-environment analysis, in Johnson et al. (2017, p.36)](https://leeds.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42LgTQStzc4rAe_hSmFm4AJWKaDzsIGIk0EIvrRMoRhy_CqwOciSB-xucTPIubmGOHvo5gCL7eJ46OhFfBJo5yjoTlwjggoAngokCw).**

This examines the nature of BP’s external environment, as shown in the PESTLE analysis, and considers the company’s potential strategic options.

[Evolve open Input]

[Question 1]

**Question:**

In light of this analysis, what strategic options would you advise a Western oil producer such as Shell or BP to consider?

[Feedback 1]

**Feedback:**

The oil industry seems to be heading for a long-term slow decline, owing to legal pressures (cutting down on carbon emissions), the decline in car usage in the West (eg the US) and potential alternative car technology. Partly cyclical, the causes of the oil price dip also reflect longer-term pressures.

However, opportunities also exist in different geographical markets (eg India), or in diversification. New technologies may bring opportunities for cost savings.

[Question 2]

**Question:**

Have the opportunities and threats changed since 2016? How would you update this analysis?

[Feedback 2]

**Feedback:**

You may want to consider the fluctuations of (and potential recovery in) the oil price as it tends to be very cyclical and linked to global economic growth. See further discussions in paragraph 2.2.2 of Johnson et al. (2017, p.38).

Some elements such as decarbonisation could be considered under different categories, Political and Ecological as well as Legal. Although opinions are divided, it is necessary to consider the impact of new technologies such as electric vehicles in the medium term (as discussed in Unit 1).
